# New Zealand Sales Data
This is New Zealand sales exploratory data analysis & visualization projects developed using power BI.

First, I used the power query editor to study and transform the data.
I first constructed a date table with numerous columns for the year, month, week, days, month-year, and weekdays. Next, I created a relationship between the date table and New Zealand.

I used Dax to create multiple columns of calculated measures for total cost, total sales, total profit, profit margin, and profit percentage. Then, I performed a date-time analysis and created additional calculated measures for last-year sales, last-year sales difference, cumulative sales, overall cumulative sales, CAGR, and YoY%.

Following the creation of all calculated columns and measures, I created a dashboard that included multiple KPIs, which countries are generating high profit, which years are high in profit, and which regions are generating high profit and sales. I also provided multiple slicers, including year, month, and date, so that we could quickly understand and analyse the data.

I produced a number of reports that included financial analysis that made it clear which months and years, when compared to others, produce the highest levels of profit, sales, and cumulative revenue. I also produced profiles for each region, nation, item, sales channel, order priority, and date-time analysis.

In the conclusion, I wrote the insights where I provided the anticipated explanation for why sales decreased in 2012 and 2015 and suggested areas where sales might grow.
